# Calendar_Gui
Desktop app for storing and viewing appointments

- This program was the last individual prograw written in my object oriented programming and design class
- It uses components from the Java Swing library to create buttons and text fields which the user can interact with
- Furthermore it uses object oriented programming strategies like interfaces, change listeners, and serialization to better implement the calendar functionalities

This program was written by Andrew Townsend, a third year computer science student at SJSU
